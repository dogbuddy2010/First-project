# First-project on GitHub
This is my first project on GitHub. I am new to this platform, so any feedback would be appreciated.

This project has files with code I am working on, and it will be updated a lot. Copilot and I are working as a team on the turtle file in this project, so please do not give all the credit to me. This is a team effort.

## Turtle Quick Exit
When using `turtle_app.py`, you can type `Stop!` at any prompt to immediately exit the program.

## Random Drawing Mode
In shape selection, choose `random` to have the turtle create a random composition using different shapes, colors, sizes, and positions.

## Running turtle_app.py
Run the app with Python:

`python turtle_app.py`
